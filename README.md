- 👋 Hi, I’m Vijay, Founder of [Datayaki](https://datayaki.com), and an Engineer. I also used to be a [Googler](https://docs.google.com), [Dropboxer](https://paper.dropbox.com), [Amazonian](https://aws.amazon.com), and most recently, a [Skiffer](https://www.skiff.com).
- 👀 I’m interested in Security/Privacy, Collaboration @ Scale using OT and CRDTs, Data Science, and Deep Learning. I'm motivated by building collaborative tools, streamlining payments & economic activity, and improving access to healthcare through applied data science. Hit me up if there is a shared interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Large Language Models and how to find Product Market Fit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an OAuth-esque auth framework for the End-to-End Encrypted Web, and on building Datayaki.
