- 👋 Hi, I’m Vijay, an Engineer. I also used to be a [Googler](https://docs.google.com), [Dropboxer](https://paper.dropbox.com), [Amazonian](https://aws.amazon.com), and most recently, a [Skiffer](https://www.skiff.com).
- 👀 I’m interested in Security/Privacy, Collaboration @ Scale using OT and CRDTs, Data Science, and Deep Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Language Models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a distributed serverless sync API, and on building Datayaki, a data analytics tool that is so easy your mother could use it. I'm motivated by work in building collaborative tools, streamlining payments & economic activity, and improving access to healthcare through applied data science.
